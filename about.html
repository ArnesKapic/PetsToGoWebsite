          <p>Founded in 1996, Pets to Go has placed an estimated 18,000 homeless cats and dogs in new households. Where do these animals come from? 40% are owner surrenders and the other 60% are animals we rescue from shelters that euthanize. We have a dedicated staff of 15 (half are part-time), and our 200-plus volunteers are our backbone. Many of the rescued animals who come to Pets to Go get more love and attention in our shelter than they’ve ever known before. Our shelter continues to grow and improve. Drop by and get to know us better!</p>
          <p >Pets to Go is a beacon of hope in Springfield, bringing joy and companionship to families and pets alike. Founded in 1996, we have proudly become the city's only no-kill animal shelter. Over the years, we've provided a loving, safe haven for approximately 18,000 homeless cats and dogs, finding them warm, welcoming homes.</p>          
          <p>Our mission extends beyond rescue and rehoming animals in need; we aim to create a community that reflects the spirit of togetherness and care. Recognizing that our visitors and supporters are as diverse as the pets we shelter, we are proud to say that our clientele spans a wide spectrum, primarily comprising families and single individuals aged between 25 to 40 years. This vibrant mix enriches our community, fostering a network of compassionate pet lovers who share in the joy of adopting and caring for a new family member.</p>
          <p>With 40% of our residents coming from owner surrenders and the remaining 60% from shelters that practice euthanasia, we strive to give these animals a second chance at life. Our dedicated staff of 15, supported by over 200 invaluable volunteers, ensures each pet receives the care, love, and attention they deserve. Our efforts are geared towards creating an environment where both pets and people feel welcome, valued, and understood, regardless of their background.</p>
          <p><em>Join us in our mission to provide love and care for pets in need. Together, we can make a difference.</em></p>
